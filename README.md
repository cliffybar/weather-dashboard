## Our Value to You

Weather is always unpredictable. One day, the weather in two days could be clear, sunny skies. But all of a sudden,
once the day arrives, it could be the complete opposite. Torrential downpour with strong winds take charge of the day
and your plans of picnic at the park are squashed. How does one prepare for such uncertainty? With Weather Dashboard.

Weather Dashboard shows you a 5-day forecast with high-speed, real-time, and accurate updates regardless of what city
you are, or will be, in.
